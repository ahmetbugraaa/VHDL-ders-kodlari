I am watching the 'FPGA Programming with VHDL' video series by Engineer Mehmet Burak Aykenar on YouTube. I am sharing the code he has provided almost exactly the same way in my own repository. In the future, I plan to write my own testbenches and make some modifications to these codes. For now, I want the codes I have learned to stay here.
